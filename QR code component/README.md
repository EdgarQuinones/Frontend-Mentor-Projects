## What I learned
- rem == 16px, useful for scaling and responsive pages
- If you want to fix an item inside a parent, you can do width/height = 100%, which will match child with parents exact measurements
- font-weight makes it more/less bold
- use max-weight/height to have items stay a certain size and not grow any bigger
